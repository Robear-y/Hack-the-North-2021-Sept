## Inspiration

Our team wanted to try learning web development, so we needed a simple but also fun project. One day at lunch, we thought of creating a personality quiz that would determine what kind of chess piece you were. This evolved into making a game where you could move around a chess piece however you like and our program would return what chess piece the moves you made were similar to.

## What it does

A player must move around a chess piece on a board, and the program will return the chess piece which moves in a similar way.

## How we built it

We built our project on repl.it, using their HTML, CSS, and JS default project option. The team did the programming all on one computer, because we were all learning together.

## Challenges we ran into

Our team had never done any kind of JS web dev project before, so we had a lot of trouble learning the languages we were using. In particular, creating an interactive chess board that looked decent was very time consuming. We tried many methods of creating a chess board, including dynamically using JS and a CSS grid. We also had trouble making our web page look good, because we did not know a lot about CSS.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The interactive chess board (TM) is the achievement we are most proud of. At one point, we didn't think moving around a piece on a board would even be possible. However, we somehow managed to pull it off.

## What we learned

We learned a lot about how HTML, CSS, and JS work together to deliver a complete functioning web page. Hack the North was a great learning experience and now the team is a lot more comfortable using the three languages.

## What's next for Chess Piece Personality Quiz

Our original idea was to take an image and analyze it to determine what chess piece the image was representing. This might be what is next for the Chess Piece Personality Program, after we've figured out how to analyze an image of course.
